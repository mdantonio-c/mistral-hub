In dev mode you need to start api service by hand. Open a terminal and run  
`$ rapydo shell backend "restapi launch"`

Now open your browser and type http://localhost in the address bar.  
You can enter the app with the following username and password

```
user@nomail.org
test
```

## Execute frontend only

You can configure your instance to only execute frontend container by connecting to a remove server for all backend services.

Edit you .projectrc file and add the folowing lines:

```
services: frontend
```

in the main section

and:

```
   BACKEND_URI: https://remote.host.url
   BACKEND_API_PORT: 443
```

in the project_configuration>variables>env section

Your .projectrc will be something like:

```
[...]
services: frontend

project_configuration:
  variables:
    env:
      [...]
      BACKEND_URI: https://remote.host.url
      BACKEND_API_PORT: 443
```

Use rapydo command as usual
